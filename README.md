# FEISTY R package

The FEISTY model (FishErIes Size and functional TYpe model) is documented as an R package. The package includes four FEISTY model setups: two published FEISTY model setups ([Petrik et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102124); [van Denderen et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13348)) and their modified versions. Also, it allows researchers to customize and simulate new FEISTY model setups, for model development and other marine science research.
