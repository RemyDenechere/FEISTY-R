\title{Run FEISTY model simulations}
\usage{
simulateFEISTY (p = setupBasic(), 
                       tEnd = 500, tStep  = 1, times = seq(from=0, to=tEnd, by=tStep), 
                       yini = p$u0, USEdll = TRUE, Rmodel = derivativesFEISTYR, 
                       bCust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A complete parameter list. \cr 
The parameter of FEISTY setups can be one of the following: \code{\link{setupBasic}}, \code{\link{setupBasic2}}, \code{\link{setupVertical}}, and \code{\link{setupVertical2}}.
Moreover, users can modify these four prepared FEISTY setups or customize new setups before calling \code{simulateFEISTY}.}

\item{tEnd}{The end time for the simulation [year], i.e., simulation period of FEISTY, in years.}

\item{tStep}{The time step for ODE solving output [year]. Default is 1. Time series results are in every year.}

\item{times}{A sequence of time points for FEISTY simulations (ODEs solving), required by function \code{\link{ode}}. For general use, the parameter does not need to be defined, since it will be generated by `tEnd` and `tStep` automatically. \cr
If `NA`, the function returns only the derivatives (one time step running) by the derivative function, which is the \code{\link{derivativesFEISTYR}} in R or the same function in FORTRAN.}

\item{yini}{A vector containing initial biomass values of all state variables (resources and all size classes). The default is imported from the setup parameter list, `p$u0`. 
If input the whole output list of a simulation (e.g., \code{yini=sim}), the biomass values of all state variables of the last time step (\code{yini=sim$u[sim$nTime,]}) will be applied to the initial values.
It can be used for successive simulations based on previous simulations.}

\item{USEdll}{Logical flag, determining whether the ODEs are solved in FORTRAN (`TRUE`) or R (`FALSE`). \cr
The \link{deSolve} package is required for both methods. Default is TRUE, \code{USEdll=FALSE} is useful in debugging or model development.
`bCust` flag input is ineffective when \code{USEdll=FALSE}.}

\item{Rmodel}{The R function for computing derivatives, defaults to \code{\link{derivativesFEISTYR}}. Generally, it should not be changed, unless users modify the model profoundly.}

\item{bCust}{Logical flag, indicates whether to use fixed setups (FALSE) or customized setups (TRUE). \cr 
Default is TRUE, which means the core FEISTY parameters generated in R are transmitted to Fortran, and the ode solving is also done by compiled language. 
\code{bCust=FALSE} is useful in debugging and model development, e,g., comparing R and FORTRAN results.
\code{bCust} flag has a lower priority than \code{USEdll} flag. \code{bCust} flag input is ineffective when \code{USEdll} flag is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing the simulation results:
\itemize{
\item u: a matrix of biomass of each state variable (column) at each time point (row), including resources and all size classes of functional types.
\item R: a matrix of biomass of each resource (column) at each time point (row).
\item B: a matrix of biomass of each size class (column) at each time point (row).
\item t: a vector containing all the simulation time points. From 0 to `tEnd`.
\item nTime: the number of time points.
\item USEdll: from parameter input.
\item p: the parameter list used in the simulation, the same as the input one.
\item f: a matrix containing feeding levels [-] of all size classes of functional types over each time point. Resources not included.
\item mortpred: a matrix containing a vector containing predation mortality rate [1/year] of all resources and all size classes of functional types over each time point. Resources not included.
\item g: a matrix containing the net growth rate [1/year] of all size classes of functional types over each time point. Resources not included.
\item Repro: a matrix containing the energy used for reproduction of all size classes of functional types over each time point, rate [g/m2/year]. Resources not included.
\item Fin: a matrix containing the biomass flux into each size class over each time point [g/m2/year]. Resources not included.
\item Fout: a matrix containing the biomass flux out of each size class over each time point [g/m2/year]. Resources not included.
\item totMort: a matrix containing the total mortality [g/m2/year] of each functional type over each time point, 
which includes predation mortality, background mortality, and fishing mortality.
\item totGrazing: a matrix containing the total grazing (food intake before assimilation) [g/m2/year] of each functional type over each time point.
Cmax * f * u (maximum consumption rate * feeding level * biomass).
\item totLoss: a matrix containing all biomass loss [g/m2/year] of each functional type over each time point, including unassimilated food, basal metabolism and reproduction cost (1-epsRepro). 
The reproduction cost here also include the energy loss (1-epsRepro) from the flux out of the last size class (invested in reproduction) of each functional type. 
These losses are supposed to be released to environments.
\item totRepro: a matrix containing the total energy used for reproduction [g/m2/year] of each functional type over each time point (before multiplying the reproduction efficiency epsRepro).
\item totRecruit: a matrix containing the total recruitment [g/m2/year] of each functional type over each time point. 
totRecruit = totRepro * epsRepro (reproduction efficiency)
\item totBiomass: a matrix containing the total biomass [g/m2] of each functional type over each time point.
\item `SSBAMean`, `SSBGMean`, `SSBMin`, `SSBMax`, and `SSB` can be found in \code{\link{calcSSB}}. \cr
`yieldAMean`, `yieldGMean`, `yieldMin`, `yieldMax`, and `yield` can be found in \code{\link{calcYield}}.

\description{
\code{simulateFEISTY} runs simulations of the FEISTY model to resolve the dynamics of marine resources and fish populations over a specified time frame. \cr
It provides options for integrating ordinary differential equations in Fortran or R for four prepared setups (\code{setupBasic}, \code{setupBasic2}, \code{setupVertical}, and \code{setupVertical2}).
}
\details{
The function runs the FEISTY model simulation over the specified time frame. \cr
The simulation supports published FEISTY setups and their revised versions:
\code{\link{setupBasic}}, \code{\link{setupBasic2}}, \code{\link{setupVertical}}, and \code{\link{setupVertical2}}, and customized setups by modelers. \cr
The simulation can be conducted by a FORTRAN-based approach or an R-based approach. Both methods rely on the \link{deSolve} package for ODE solving. 
For efficiency, FORTRAN dll should be used. For model development, the R-version is preferred.
Simulations based on customized setups can only be done with the FORTRAN-based approach.
