\arguments{
\item{sim}{The dataframe of FEISTY simulation results.}

\description{
Makes a plot with all feeding interactions of fish functional groups and 
resources. The size of the biomass circles and feeding fluxes are divided by 
the maximum biomass or flux and re-scaled with the cube root.
The function works on the four prepared setups or revised 
versions based on these four setups. If customized setups by users have 
more resources and/or fish functional types, this plot function may need to be updated.
