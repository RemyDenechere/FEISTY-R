\title{Plots for growth rate, mortality, and feeding level}
\usage{
plotRates(sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{The data frame of FEISTY simulation results.}
}
\description{
Plots growth rate (1/year), mortality (1/year), and feeding level (dimensionless) over the size spectrum.
}
\details{
The growth rate here denotes the fraction of the available energy that can be invested in growth (Eq. 15 in vignette), 
which is not the growth rate from a size class to the next neighboring class (Eq. 16 in vignette).

The mortality panel displays the total mortality, which is the sum of background mortality, fishing mortality and predation mortality. 

The feeding level calculation is in Eq. 10 in vignettes.

Data are averaged over a selected time period (last 40% of the simulation time).
